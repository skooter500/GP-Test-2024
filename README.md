## Instructions

- Fork this repository to your own github account
- Clone the forked repository to your computer
- Open the Godot starter project. This has all the Godot examples we made this semester
- Start with an empty scene and create what you see in the video above

## What is happening

- There is a slider that has values from 1-20 and a label that shows the current value
- This slider determines the number of Godot logos to spawn
- When you click on the button, the logos will spawn in a circle around the central logo
- The logos have gravity and will fall
- When they land they explode and disappear

There are examples of most of the above in the repo and you can use the following resources:

- [Godot Quick reference](https://github.com/skooter500/csresources/blob/master/godot_ref.pdf)
- [git quick reference](https://github.com/skooter500/csresources/blob/master/git_ref.pdf)

- [Godot online reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) 
- [Git online referenc](https://git-scm.com/docs)
